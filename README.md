# RockTypePropagation
I tried to make a propagation of Rock Type using linear model, random forest, and neural networks. It works but apparently there is a very few data that can be used both to train and validate during the process. I need to look for another approach to overcome this issue. This is also my first time trying to use Google Colab. If you are interested please check on this link below.
